//! Session service for managing Engine WebSocket connection
//!
//! This service handles:
//! - Connecting to the Engine WebSocket server
//! - Sending JoinSession messages
//! - Processing server messages and updating application state
//!
//! NOTE: This service currently has some architecture violations that will be
//! addressed in Phase 16. Specifically:
//! - Uses infrastructure types (WorldSnapshot, ServerMessage)
//! - This service publishes raw JSON; presentation parses into message DTOs
