///
/// - **Desktop (tokio)**: Uses async/await with Send + Sync requirements
/// - **WASM**: Uses callbacks and single-threaded model
///
/// NOTE: This trait is intentionally **object-safe** so the presentation layer can
/// store an `Arc<dyn GameConnectionPort>` without depending on concrete
/// infrastructure types.
